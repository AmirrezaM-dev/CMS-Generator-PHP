# CMS Generator Vanilla PHP

My very first major project was built in 2018 using Vanilla PHP 7.3.

As a freelancer, I wanted a tool or 'cheat code' to help me complete projects faster while maintaining high quality. That's when I developed this project, which I called the CMS generator. This application creates tables in a MySQL database based on the answers you provide to specific questions. It then allows you to modify the database data according to your preferences.

For example, if you need a dynamic navigation bar on your website, you can create a table in the CMS and define fields such as 'title' and 'url'. This enables you to easily add navigation items to your website using the titles and URLs defined in the table.

The CMS generator offers many other functionalities, such as input-select-file options and more. Additionally, it includes a built-in file manager that allows you to securely upload and download files. Only administrators can access and download these files from the CMS portal itself.
